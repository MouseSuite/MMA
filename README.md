# MouseSuite MRI Atlas (MMA)
The MouseSuite MRI Atlas (MMA) is a MRI-based neuroanatomical reference atlas for use with atlas-based morphometry and volume microscopy registration.
The atlas currently comprises 41 neuroanatomical structures delineated upon an average template composed of 60 healthy (30 male, 30 female) T2-weighted C57BL/6J mouse brain images.
It provides a common space in which MRI and microscopy comparisons can be made.
